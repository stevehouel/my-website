I am a #AWS #All9 certified Cloud Architect at Ippon Technologies. My field of expertise is DevOps & Cloud-based technologies and more specifically Serverless architectures. Speaker at events, contributor to OSS projects like JHipster or daSWAG and writer of blog articles or white papers "Serverless architectures, from theory to practice" in my spare time. You should have understood that, I love technology #CloudAddict
